# 🚀 About Me  

Welcome to my GitHub! I've been coding in **Lua** for over **five years**, building **secure, efficient, and powerful** scripts. My main focus is on **reverse engineering, game security, and Lua decompilation**, specializing in **dumping functions, analyzing vulnerabilities, and enhancing game protection**.  

I work on a variety of projects, including:  
- **Game security & exploit prevention** 🔐  
- **Custom Lua decompilers & function dumpers** 🛠️  
- **Advanced server-side and client-side whitelisting systems** 🔄  
- **Obfuscation & bypass detection for Roblox utilities** 👀  

I'm always pushing the limits of **what’s possible with Lua**, constantly refining my skills and tools to stay ahead of exploiters.

# 🛡️ AntiDevs – Fighting Exploits in Roblox  

I’m part of **AntiDevs**, a team dedicated to **protecting Roblox games** from cheaters and exploiters. Our main focus is on securing **Trident Survival** and other games by:  

- **Dumping and decompiling scripts** to analyze vulnerabilities 📜  
- **Finding exploits and security flaws** before cheaters can abuse them 🔍  
- **Helping developers patch weak spots** in their anti-cheats 🛠️  
- **Staying ahead of exploiters** with constant updates and research 🚀  

With a deep understanding of **how cheats work**, we ensure that **game security stays one step ahead**. Our goal is to make games **more secure, harder to exploit, and fair for all players**.
